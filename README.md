## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)

```
backend/
├── main.py              # FastAPI application
│   ├── /api/start       # Create interview session (accepts resume upload)

│   └── /api/health      # Health check
├── question_bank.json   # Base question library (15 questions)
└── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

**Key Backend Features:**
- FormData handling for resume uploads
- Resume text parsing (up to 3000 characters)

## 🔌 API Documentation

### POST /api/start

Create a new interview session with optional resume.

**Request (FormData):**
```
role: "software_engineer" | "sales" | "retail"
persona: "neutral" | "confused" | "efficient" | "chatty"
resume: File (optional)
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "role": "software_engineer",
  "persona": "neutral",
  "started_at": "2025-11-24T12:00:00"
}
```

### POST /api/next

Get next question or submit answer for evaluation.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "user_text": "My answer..." // Empty string to get first question
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "next_question": "Next interview question...",
  "feedback": "Constructive feedback on your answer",
  "followups": ["Optional follow-up questions"],
  "end_session": false,
  "summary": null // Populated when interview ends
}
```

### GET /api/health

Health check endpoint.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "groq_configured": true
}
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Interview Flow

1. **Session Creation**: User selects role, persona, and optionally uploads resume
2. **Resume Processing**: System parses resume text (first 3000 characters)
3. **Contextual Introduction**: First question references resume if provided
4. **Answer Evaluation**: Groq LLM scores answer (1-10) and provides feedback
5. **Adaptive Questioning**:
   - Score ≥ 8: Move to next question
   - Score < 8: Ask up to 2 follow-up questions
6. **Dynamic Generation**: If resume provided, AI generates contextual questions
7. **Final Summary**: LLM analyzes full interview transcript and provides comprehensive feedback

### AI Intelligence

**Resume Context Integration:**
```python
# Questions reference candidate's specific experience
"Can you elaborate on the scalable web applications you mentioned 
serving millions of users in your background?"
```

**Persona-Matched Feedback:**
- **Professional**: Balanced, objective assessment
- **Inquisitive**: Asks for more details, explores deeper
- **Direct**: Brief, actionable feedback
- **Friendly**: Warm, encouraging tone

**Adaptive Follow-Ups:**
- Triggered when score < 8
- Maximum 2 per question
- Helps candidates improve incomplete answers

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Roles

Edit `backend/question_bank.json`:

```json
{
  "product_manager": [
    {
      "id": "pm_1",
      "text": "Describe your product roadmap process.",
      "followups": [
        "How do you prioritize features?",
        "How do you handle stakeholder disagreements?"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then update frontend role options in `App.jsx`.

### Changing LLM Model

Update in `backend/main.py`:

```python
chat_completion = groq_client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=messages,
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",  # Change model here
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1024,
)
```

Available Groq models:
- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (Default - balanced performance)
- `llama-3.2-90b-text-preview` (Most capable)
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768` (Large context window)

### Adjusting Scoring Criteria

Modify `evaluate_answer()` in `backend/main.py`:

```python
system_prompt = f"""Rate based on:
- Clarity (30%)
- Completeness (30%)
- Relevance (20%)
- Specific examples (20%)
"""
```

### Customizing Timer Limits

Add maximum time limits in `frontend/src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (stage === 'interview' && !interviewEnded) {
    timerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      setTimer(prev => {
        if (prev >= 3600) { // 60 minute limit
          setInterviewEnded(true)
          return prev
        }
        return prev + 1
      })
    }, 1000)
  }
}, [stage, interviewEnded])
```

## 📝 Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key for LLM access | Yes |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Failed to start interview"
- **Solution**: Verify GROQ_API_KEY is set in Replit Secrets

**Issue**: Voice input not working
- **Solution**: Use Chrome or Edge browser (Safari/Firefox have limited support)

**Issue**: Resume not being used in questions
- **Solution**: Ensure resume file is .txt format or contains readable text

**Issue**: Timer not starting
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and start a new interview

**Issue**: Questions seem repetitive
- **Solution**: Upload a resume for personalized, context-aware questions

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Candidates

1. **Upload Your Resume**: Get personalized questions matching your experience
2. **Use Full Sentences**: AI evaluates clarity and completeness
3. **Provide Examples**: Specific stories score higher than generic answers
4. **Watch the Timer**: Practice time management for real interviews
5. **Review Feedback**: Learn from each answer before continuing

### For Developers

1. **Resume Format**: Encourage plain text (.txt) for best parsing
2. **Token Limits**: Resume parsing limited to 3000 chars to save API costs
3. **Error Handling**: All API calls have try-catch with user-friendly messages
4. **Session Management**: In-memory sessions - consider Redis for production
5. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limits to prevent API abuse

## 📊 Performance

- **Question Generation**: ~2-3 seconds per question
- **Answer Evaluation**: ~3-4 seconds per evaluation
- **Resume Processing**: <1 second for parsing
- **Total Interview Time**: 20-45 minutes typically

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- Resume data stored only during session (in-memory)
- No persistent storage of personal information
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- File upload size limits enforced
- Text extraction only (no file storage)
